## Description

**Motivation:** Small business owners have a lot of tasks on the go at any given time. 
To assist in keeping track of all of these tasks, and thoughts, this application will allow the user to write, save, and delete notes easily.
 

**The Why:** To aid in the consolidation of multiple tasks and thoughts, in a concise way without wasting paper or being surrounded by post-it notes.

**Problem Solved:** This app allows the user to access their notes across multiple devices at any given time. 
It prevents the loss of notes, and assists with the chaos of losing track of details, tasks, and thought processes that cannot be immediately dealt with. 

**Lessons:** This application allowed me to practice using express.js, modular-routing, the use of middleware and finally to utilise get, post, and delete requests
